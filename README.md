This repository contains the jupyter notebooks, coded in Julia (https://julialang.org/), used to solve the numerical examples presented in my thesis, titled One-Step Ahead Optimal Control for Discrete-Time Systems and Applications.

The folder named "Chap-3" contains the jupyter notebooks related to the paper "Linear quadratic discrete-time dynamic games via one-step ahead iterative algorithms".

The folder named "Chap-4" contains the jupyter notebooks related to the paper "Inventory management through one-step ahead optimal control based on linear programming" (https://www.rairo-ro.org/articles/ro/abs/2023/01/ro220199/ro220199.html). 
Although the original paper transcribed the SESC dynamics into MILP problems, in the appendix A of my thesis, we proved that this problems are equivalent to LP problems. The codes were updated to reflect that change.
